- **Citation Generation**: Generate properly formatted citations in various academic styles
- **Research Analysis**: Provide intelligent summaries and insights from academic content
- **Conversational Interface**: Interactive Q&A about research topics and papers
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time processing and display of analysis results
- **Role-Based Analysis**: Configurable analysis styles for different academic disciplines

## What Does It Do?

The Academic Agent performs several key functions:

1. **Paper Discovery**: Searches academic databases to find relevant research papers
2. **Document Processing**: Parses and extracts content from PDF research papers
3. **Content Analysis**: Provides intelligent summaries and key insights from academic papers
4. **Citation Management**: Generates properly formatted citations in various styles (APA, MLA, etc.)
5. **Research Assistance**: Answers questions about research topics and methodologies
6. **Literature Review**: Helps identify trends and gaps in academic literature

## Example Usage

### Basic Paper Analysis

```rust
use kowalski_academic_agent::AcademicAgent;
use kowalski_core::config::Config;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize the academic agent
    let config = Config::default();
    let mut academic_agent = AcademicAgent::new(config).await?;
    
    // Start a conversation
    let conversation_id = academic_agent.start_conversation("llama3.2");
    
    // Process a research paper
    let paper_path = "path/to/research_paper.pdf";
    let response = academic_agent
        .chat_with_history(&conversation_id, paper_path, None)
        .await?;
    
    // Process streaming response...
    Ok(())
}
```

### Advanced Research with Custom Roles

```rust
use kowalski_core::role::{Audience, Preset, Role};

// Create a specialized role for computer science research
let role = Role::new(
    "Computer Science Research Assistant",
    "You are an expert in computer science research, specializing in machine learning and AI.",
)
.with_audience(Audience::new(
    "Computer Science Researcher",
    "You are speaking to a computer science researcher who needs detailed technical analysis.",
))
.with_preset(Preset::new(
    "Technical Analysis",
    "Focus on technical details, algorithms, and experimental results.",
));

// Use the role in paper analysis
let response = academic_agent
    .chat_with_history(&conversation_id, paper_path, Some(role))
    .await?;
```

### Paper Search and Discovery

```rust
// Search for academic papers
let search_results = academic_agent.search_papers("machine learning transformers").await?;

for result in search_results {
    println!("Title: {}", result.title);
    println!("Authors: {}", result.authors);
    println!("Abstract: {}", result.abstract_text);
    println!("URL: {}", result.url);
    println!("---");
}
```

### Citation Generation

```rust
// Generate a citation for a reference
let citation = academic_agent.generate_citation("Attention Is All You Need").await?;
println!("Citation: {}", citation.citation);
println!("Format: {}", citation.format);
```

### Follow-up Research Questions

```rust
// Ask specific follow-up questions about the research
let follow_up = "What are the main contributions and limitations of this paper?";
let follow_up_response = academic_agent
    .chat_with_history(&conversation_id, follow_up, None)
    .await?;
```

## How Could It Be Extended?

The Academic Agent is designed with extensibility in mind and can be enhanced in several ways:

    acm_tool: ACMTool,
}
```

### 2. Advanced Document Processing

```rust
// Support for more document formats and advanced parsing
pub struct AdvancedAcademicAgent {
    agent: AcademicAgent,
    latex_parser: LatexParser,
    word_processor: WordProcessor,
    figure_extractor: FigureExtractor,
    table_extractor: TableExtractor,
}
```

### 3. Literature Review Tools

```rust
// Automated literature review and synthesis
pub struct LiteratureReviewAgent {
    agent: AcademicAgent,
    citation_analyzer: CitationAnalyzer,
    trend_detector: TrendDetector,
    gap_analyzer: GapAnalyzer,
    synthesis_engine: SynthesisEngine,
}
```

### 4. Research Collaboration Features

```rust
// Multi-user research collaboration
pub struct CollaborativeAcademicAgent {
    agent: AcademicAgent,
    user_manager: UserManager,
    annotation_system: AnnotationSystem,
    discussion_forum: DiscussionForum,
