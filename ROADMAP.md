> "The future is modular, and so is Kowalski. Want a feature? Open an issue or submit a PR!"

## ðŸ§© Modular Architecture (since 0.5.0)

Kowalski is now split into clear, focused modules:
- **Core**: Foundational types, agent abstractions, conversation, roles, configuration, error handling, toolchain logic
- **Tools**: Pluggable tools for code, data, web, and document analysis
- **Template**: Agent builder, base agent, and ready-to-use agent templates
- **Federation**: (WIP) Multi-agent orchestration, registry, and protocols
- **Agents**: Specific agents (academic, code, data, web, etc.)
- **CLI**: Command-line interface

## Long-Term Vision & Open Questions
- **Protocol selection for federation:** A2A, ACP, MCP, or custom?
- **Advanced agent orchestration:** Multi-agent, federated, and plugin-based development
- **Persistent state:** Should agent state and task history be persisted?
- **Security:** How do agents authenticate and authorize each other?
- **Scalability:** What are the bottlenecks for large federations?
- **Extensibility:** How can new agent types and protocols be plugged in?
- **Community:** Encourage contributions, feature requests, and protocol discussions
