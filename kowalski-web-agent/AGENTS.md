## 1. Philosophy & Core Principles

### Core Philosophy
- **Incremental progress over big bangs**: Break complex tasks into manageable stages
- **Learn from existing code**: Understand patterns before implementing new features
- **Clear intent over clever code**: Prioritize readability and maintainability
- **Simple over complex**: Keep implementations straightforward - prioritize solving problems over architectural complexity

### The Eight Honors and Eight Shames
| **Shame** | **Honor** |
|-----------|-----------|
| Guessing APIs | Careful research and documentation reading |
| Vague execution | Seeking confirmation before major changes |
| Assuming business logic | Human verification of requirements |
| Creating new interfaces | Reusing existing, proven patterns |
| Skipping validation | Proactive testing and error handling |
| Breaking architecture | Following established specifications |
| Pretending to understand | Honest acknowledgment of uncertainty |
| Blind modification | Careful, incremental refactoring |

### SOLID Principles Integration
Our codebase follows SOLID principles to ensure maintainable, scalable software.

**Quick Reference**: See [`tools/solid_principles_quick_reference.md`](tools/solid_principles_quick_reference.md) for essential patterns and checklists.

**Detailed Guide**: See [`tools/solid_principles_guide.md`](tools/solid_principles_guide.md) for comprehensive examples and implementation strategies.

#### Core SOLID Guidelines for AI Development
- **Single Responsibility (SRP)**: Before adding functionality, ask "Does this belong here?"
- **Open/Closed (OCP)**: Extend behavior through new classes/modules, not modifications
- **Liskov Substitution (LSP)**: Ensure any subclass can replace its parent without breaking functionality
- **Interface Segregation (ISP)**: Design small, specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones
- **Dependency Inversion (DIP)**: Inject dependencies rather than creating them directly

## 8. Critical Rules & Protocols

### Rule 0: Read Component Documentation First
**Before working on any specific component, ALWAYS read its AGENTS.md file first.**

Component-specific files contain crucial information about:
- Architecture patterns specific to that component
- Development workflows and testing procedures
- Technology-specific considerations and best practices
- Common issues and troubleshooting steps
- Integration patterns with other services

### Rule 1: Create Plan First
Never start a complex task without creating a `task.md` file. Use the template in `tools/task_template.md`.

**When to create a task plan:**
- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Research or analysis tasks
- Building/creating new components
- Tasks spanning multiple files or components

### Rule 2: The 2-Action Rule
> "After every 2 view/browser/search operations, IMMEDIATELY save key findings to text files."

This prevents loss of visual/multimodal information and maintains context across long sessions.

### Rule 3: Read Before You Decide
Before making major decisions, re-read the plan file and relevant documentation to ensure alignment with goals and architecture.

### Rule 4: Update After You Act
After completing any phase:
- Mark phase status: `pending` → `in_progress` → `complete`
- Log any errors encountered with resolution details
- Note files created, modified, or deleted
- Update decision log with rationale

### Rule 5: Log ALL Errors
Every error goes in the task plan file with:
- Error description
- Attempt number
- Resolution approach
- Lessons learned

```markdown
## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution | Lessons Learned |
|-------|---------|------------|----------------|
| FileNotFoundError | 1 | Created default config | Check file existence first |
| API timeout | 2 | Added retry logic | Network calls need resilience |
```

### Rule 6: Never Repeat Failures
```
if action_failed:
    next_action != same_action
```
Track what you tried. Mutate the approach. Learn from failures.

### The 3-Strike Error Protocol

```
ATTEMPT 1: Diagnose & Fix
  → Read error message carefully
  → Identify root cause
  → Apply targeted fix

ATTEMPT 2: Alternative Approach  
  → Same error? Try different method
  → Different tool? Different library?
  → NEVER repeat exact same failing action

ATTEMPT 3: Broader Rethink
  → Question initial assumptions
  → Search for solutions and best practices
  → Consider updating the plan or approach

AFTER 3 FAILURES: Escalate to User
  → Explain what you tried in detail
  → Share the specific error messages
  → Ask for guidance or clarification
```

### Context Management Protocol

#### Read vs Write Decision Matrix
| Situation | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Just wrote a file | DON'T read | Content still in context |
| Viewed image/PDF | Write findings NOW | Multimodal data doesn't persist |
| Browser returned data | Write to file | Screenshots are temporary |
| Starting new phase | Read plan/findings | Re-orient if context is stale |
| Error occurred | Read relevant files | Need current state to debug |
| Resuming after gap | Read all planning files | Recover full state |

#### The 5-Question Context Check
If you can answer these questions, your context management is solid:

| Question | Answer Source |
|----------|---------------|
| Where am I? | Current phase in task.md |
| Where am I going? | Remaining phases in task.md |
| What's the goal? | Goal statement in plan |
| What have I learned? | Findings and decisions in task.md |
| What have I done? | Progress tracking in task.md |

## Legacy Component Context

# kowalski-web-agent: Specialized Agent for Web Research

## 1. Purpose

The `kowalski-web-agent` crate implements a specialized AI agent focused on retrieving and processing information from the internet. It utilizes tools for web searching, content extraction, and summarization to answer queries that require up-to-date or external knowledge. It demonstrates how to combine `kowalski-core` and web-focused tools from `kowalski-tools`.

## 2. Structure

The structure of `kowalski-web-agent/src` is:

*   **`agent.rs`**: The core `WebAgent` implementation, wrapping a `TemplateAgent` and providing web-specific system prompts and tool configurations.
*   **`config.rs`**: Configuration details specifically for the web agent.
*   **`error.rs`**: Custom error types for this crate.
*   **`lib.rs`**: Main library interface.

## 3. Strengths

*   **Valuable Specialization:** Web research is a fundamental capability for modern AI agents. This crate provides a clear, focused implementation of that capability.
*   **Dynamic Tool Prompt Generation (Noted Improvement):** Unlike the `kowalski-academic-agent`, the `kowalski-web-agent` (specifically in `agent.rs`) dynamically generates the "AVAILABLE TOOLS" section of its system prompt by querying the registered tools for their definitions. This is a significant strength and a best practice that should be adopted across all agents. It makes the agent's prompt robust to changes in tool definitions.
*   **Clear Use Case:** The system prompt effectively defines the agent's persona as an expert researcher and outlines a logical workflow (search -> extract -> synthesize).

## 4. Weaknesses

*   **Hardcoded Tool Creation:** Similar to other specialized agents, the tools (`WebSearchTool`, `WebScrapeTool`) are instantiated directly within `WebAgent::new`. This limits configurability without source code changes.
*   **Limited Advanced Web Interaction:** Currently, the agent likely relies on basic HTTP requests for scraping. It lacks capabilities for interacting with complex, JavaScript-heavy single-page applications (SPAs), solving CAPTCHAs, or managing browser sessions (cookies, state).
*   **Dependency on External Services:** `WebSearchTool` likely relies on an external API (like Brave, DuckDuckGo, or Google). Managing API keys, rate limits, and service outages adds complexity and fragility.
*   **Potential for Context Bloat:** Web scraping can return massive amounts of text. If the agent indiscriminately feeds this text into the LLM context, it can quickly exceed token limits or degrade performance. Effective summarization or chunking mechanisms within the tools or the agent's pre-processing phase are necessary.

## 5. Potential Improvements & Integration into Rebuild

To elevate the capabilities of the `kowalski-web-agent` in the new architecture:

*   **Configurable Tool Instantiation:** Implement a configuration-driven mechanism for instantiating tools, similar to the recommendation for `kowalski-academic-agent`.
*   **Browser Automation Capabilities:** Integrate tools that provide headless browser control (e.g., using libraries wrapping Playwright or Puppeteer) to handle dynamic content, navigate SPAs, and perform more complex web interactions than simple scraping.
*   **Robust Content Processing:** Enhance the tools or the agent's workflow to include robust text extraction (removing boilerplate HTML), chunking, and preliminary summarization *before* passing large web pages to the main LLM context round.
*   **Fact-Checking and Source Verification:** Introduce functionalities (or tools) that specifically help the agent verify the credibility of sources or cross-reference information found online.
*   **Stateful Web Sessions:** Allow the agent to maintain state across multiple web interactions (e.g., logging into a site and navigating through it), which might require specialized memory or context management.
*   **Promote Dynamic Prompting:** Ensure the dynamic prompt generation technique used here is standard practice across the ` Kowalski` framework via the `ToolManager`.

By enhancing its web interaction capabilities and managing the volume of retrieved information effectively, `kowalski-web-agent` can become a highly capable and reliable research assistant.
